# upskilling-c-sharp
From zero to hero, in C#

Workflow:

- Fork the repository
- For each issue in [issues](https://github.com/DeveintLabs/upskilling-c-sharp/issues), create a branch thus:
  
  ```
  <issue-number>-issue-tittle>
  e.g.
  1-hr-arraysum for the first issue on this repo.
  ```
- Work out your solution from the branch, then commit changes and push.
- Raise a PR against your `master` branch (not this project's master branch).
- Your PR will then be reviewed by your peers and merged appropriately
